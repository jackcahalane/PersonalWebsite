    <h2>Cloud Certification Resources</h2>
    <p>
        I found the following resources useful when studying for my AWS certifications
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/">Stephane Maarek Solution Architecture Associate course on Udemy</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/">Stephane Maarek SysOps Administrator Associate course on Udemy</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/">Stephane Maarek Developer Associate course on Udemy</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner">ACloudGuru Cloud Practitioner course</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product-category/aws-practice-exams/">TutorialsDojo Practice Exams</a> I found it helpful to buy these direct on the Tutorials Dojo site then go through review mode first, then section mode and finally timed mode. 
                This allowed me to learn from my mistakes immediately during my first few practice tests and really understand why I was wrong. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/">Reddit AWS Certifications</a> for general tips. Posts often give a good idea on content to expect on the exam.
            </li>
        </ul>
        For the exam lab component of SysOps Admin Associate, the TutorialsDojo exam papers have some samples, but in the exam itself I had to create a VPC, a CloudWatch metrics filter and something to do with SSM. They were extremely easy once you actually use the console on a daily basis.
