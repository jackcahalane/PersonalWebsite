    <h2>German Word a Day</h2>
    <p>Below is an illustration of the "German Word a Day" application I built to provide me with a bit of a daily prompt to review German vocab. 
        I was inspired by Emily Shea's similar, and far superior, app for Chinese. Details on this can be found on <a href="https://emshea.com/post/chinese-vocab-app">here</a>. For vocab, I originally used 
        the csv dictionary from <a href="https://www.dict.cc/">dict.cc</a> but the file I had with 100,000+ translations was a bit unwieldy and also included a lot of slang from Afrikaaners for some reason?
        I then switched to using the lists from <a href="https://www.sketchengine.eu/german-word-list/">sketchengine.eu</a> as it was a more focused vocab list, albeit quite basic.

        For the initial notification, I was using SNS with my email as the target, but that resulted in this garbled message. Duolingo's UI it is not.

            I then moved to using SES and having some HTML styling in the Lambda function when it prepares the mail. Being able to mask the email that was sending the mail out was also a benefit of switching to SES.

            </figure>
       <br>
            One to note as well, is that the "Test" fucntion in the Lambda console does not work at all for asynchronous invocations. To test this, it has to be run from the CLI or triggered from EventBridge.
        Knowing this in advance would have saved me an hour of frustration.

    <h2>Cloud Certification Resources</h2>
    <p>
        I found the following resources useful when studying for my AWS certifications
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/">Stephane Maarek Solution Architecture Associate course on Udemy</a>

            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/">Stephane Maarek Developer Associate course on Udemy</a>
            </li>

                <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner">ACloudGuru Cloud Practitioner course</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product-category/aws-practice-exams/">TutorialsDojo Practice Exams</a> I found it helpful to buy these direct on the Tutorials Dojo site then go through review mode first, then section mode and finally timed mode. 
                This allowed me to learn from my mistakes immediately during my first few practice tests and really understand why I was wrong. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AWSCertifications/">Reddit AWS Certifications</a> for general tips. Posts often give a good idea on content to expect on the exam.
            </li>
        </ul>
        For the exam lab component of SysOps Admin Associate, the TutorialsDojo practice exams have some samples. In the exam itself I had to create a VPC, a CloudWatch metrics filter and something to do with SSM. They were extremely easy once you actually use the console on a daily basis.
