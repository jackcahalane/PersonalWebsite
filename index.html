    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>Jack Cahalane here. I currently live in London (Clapham stereotypically) and work at Accenture. Hailing from Dublin's fair city, I previously
        studied Physics & Astrophysics at Trinty College Dublin where I finished first in my class and received a Gold Medal for exceptional merit. 
        I run religiously, read voraciously and am (perhaps foolishly) endeavouring to learn German.<br>
        <br>
        At the moment, I'm particularly interested in Cloud and FinOps while also working my way through AWS certifications (4 down, at least 2 more to go). <br>
        <br>
        <a href="https://jackcahalane-blog-bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bookshelf.html">Bookshelf</a>, books I've thought good enough to finish since 2018 and some recommendations.<br>
        <a href="https://jackcahalane-blog-bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/cloud.html">Cloud</a>, some things I've built on the cloud and some resources for getting certified.<br>
        <a href="https://jackcahalane-blog-bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/races.html">Races</a>, ones I've run and would recommend.<br>
